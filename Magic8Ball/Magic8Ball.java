/*

Magic 8 Ball is a toy developed in the 1950s and used for fortune-telling or advice-seeking. 
A player asks or thinks of a yes-or-no question such as Will I be rich someday? 
The player then turns the ball over to see one of 20 randomly chosen responsesâ€”for example, 
It is certain or Very doubtful.
